# prometheus-kafka-adapter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter)

Prometheus-kafka-adapter is a service which receives [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus) metrics through [`remote_write`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write), marshal into JSON and sends them into [Kafka](https://github.com/apache/kafka).

## output

It is able to write JSON or Avro-JSON messages in a kafka topic, depending on the `SERIALIZATION_FORMAT` configuration variable.

### JSON

```json
{
  "timestamp": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "value": "9876543210",
  "name": "up",

  "labels": {
    "__name__": "up",
    "label1": "value1",
    "label2": "value2"
  }
}
```

`timestamp` and `value` are reserved values, and can't be used as label names. `__name__` is a special label that defines the name of the metric and is copied as `name` to the top level for convenience.

### Avro JSON

The Avro-JSON serialization is the same. See the [Avro schema](./schemas/metric.avsc).

## configuration

### prometheus-kafka-adapter

There is a docker image `telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter:1.6.0` [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/telefonica/prometheus-kafka-adapter/).

Prometheus-kafka-adapter listens for metrics coming from Prometheus and sends them to Kafka. This behaviour can be configured with the following environment variables:

- `KAFKA_BROKER_LIST`: defines kafka endpoint and port, defaults to `kafka:9092`.
- `KAFKA_TOPIC`: defines kafka topic to be used, defaults to `metrics`. Could use go template, labels are passed (as a map) to the template: e.g: `metrics.{{ index . "__name__" }}` to use per-metric topic. Two template functions are available: replace (`{{ index . "__name__" | replace "message" "msg" }}`) and substring (`{{ index . "__name__" | substring 0 5 }}`)
- `KAFKA_COMPRESSION`: defines the compression type to be used, defaults to `none`.
- `KAFKA_BATCH_NUM_MESSAGES`: defines the number of messages to batch write, defaults to `10000`.
- `SERIALIZATION_FORMAT`: defines the serialization format, can be `json`, `avro-json`, defaults to `json`.
- `PORT`: defines http port to listen, defaults to `8080`, used directly by [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).
- `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`: basic auth username to be used for receive endpoint, defaults is no basic auth.
- `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`: basic auth password to be used for receive endpoint, defaults is no basic auth.
- `LOG_LEVEL`: defines log level for [`logrus`](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus), can be `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal` or `panic`, defaults to `info`.
- `GIN_MODE`: manage [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) debug logging, can be `debug` or `release`.

To connect to Kafka over SSL define the following additonal environment variables:

- `KAFKA_SSL_CLIENT_CERT_FILE`: Kafka SSL client certificate file, defaults to `""`
- `KAFKA_SSL_CLIENT_KEY_FILE`: Kafka SSL client certificate key file, defaults to `""`
- `KAFKA_SSL_CLIENT_KEY_PASS`: Kafka SSL client certificate key password (optional), defaults to `""`
- `KAFKA_SSL_CA_CERT_FILE`: Kafka SSL broker CA certificate file, defaults to `""`

When deployed in a Kubernetes cluster using Helm and using a Kafka external to the cluster, it might be necessary to define the kafka hostname resolution locally (this fills the /etc/hosts of the container). Use a custom values.yaml file with section `hostAliases` (as mentioned in default values.yaml).

### prometheus

Prometheus needs to have a `remote_write` url configured, pointing to the '/receive' endpoint of the host and port where the prometheus-kafka-adapter service is running. For example:

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: "http://prometheus-kafka-adapter:8080/receive"
```

When deployed in a Kubernetes cluster using Helm and using an external Prometheus, it might be necessary to expose prometheus-kafka-adapter input port as a node port. Use a custom values.yaml file to set `service.type: NodePort` and `service.nodeport: <PortNumber>` (see comments in default values.yaml)

## development

```
